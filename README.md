# jao-portfolio

## Description
This project is intended to highlight the major career milestones of my newfound coding career and, in doing so, demonstrate everything I've learned and practiced thus far. This project specifically includes HTML and CSS/advanced CSS, meaning it is adaptable to all screen-types and interactive. It will also be useful in connecting with other coders and future employers.

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
Special shoutout to my instructor (John Desrosiers), my tutor (Ryan Skog), and my classmates (David Luu, Chris Muto, and ???)
