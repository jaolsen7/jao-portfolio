# jao-portfolio

## Description
This project is intended to highlight the major career milestones of my newfound coding career and, in doing so, demonstrate everything I've learned and practiced thus far. This project specifically includes HTML and CSS/advanced CSS, meaning it is adaptable to all screen-types and interactive. It will also be useful in connecting with other coders and future employers.
